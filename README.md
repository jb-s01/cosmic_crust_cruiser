## The Intergalactic Pizza Odyssey

In the vast expanse of the retro-futuristic galaxy, where starlight twinkles like the cheese on a freshly baked pizza, you are the most daring pilot of the "Cosmic Crust Cruiser," the galaxy's premier pizza delivery spacecraft.

### Backstory

In an era where interplanetary internet has made digital dine-out a cosmic possibility, one pizzeria stands out amongst the stars: **Big Bang Pizza**. With the motto "Pizza at the Speed of Light," they were once just a tiny diner on a minor asteroid belt. But with their latest invention, the superluminal delivery ship known as the "Cosmic Crust Cruiser," they're now the hottest name in the Milky Way.

As the chosen pilot, you've been tasked to navigate through meteor showers, outmaneuver sneaky space pirates, and skirt the event horizons of black holes - all to deliver the most sizzling, cheesy, and mouth-watering pizzas to the farthest corners of the galaxy.

### Your Mission (Should You Choose to Digest It)

- **Navigate the Nebulas**: Chart your course through the galaxy's most pizza-friendly routes.
- **Dodge the Danger**: Asteroids and enemy ships are the least of your worries when every second late means a colder pizza.
- **Deliver the Delicious**: Time is cheese! Get those pizzas delivered while they're hot or face the wrath of a hangry alien.
- **Upgrade and Outmaneuver**: Collect cosmic coins to upgrade your cruiser with quantum ovens, photon boosters, and mozzarella missiles.

### Game Features

- **Pizza-Time Continuum**: Battle the relativity of time itself to deliver pizzas in a timely fashion.
- **Cheese Asteroids & Pepperoni Planets**: Discover and explore a galaxy filled with pizza-themed celestial bodies.
- **Space Pirates with a Taste for Toppings**: Encounter and evade notorious pizza plunderers who want a slice of your pie.

Prepare for an adventure topped with excitement, sprinkled with danger, and loaded with extra cheese. Your legend as the greatest pizza delivery pilot in the cosmos awaits!
